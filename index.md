	<p>
		In Rail Recon, you are taking control of a reconnaissance robot tasked with discovering the depths and secrets of an old mining facility, known as "Project Tunnel". Communication with the outside world is cut, and armed only with a laser cannon you must fight through the facility's defenses to complete your mission.
	</p>
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Mazes of rails and puzzle-like traps make it clear, you are not welcome here.</li>
	<li>Armed with a Laser cannon you must take out enemies on your way to the exit.</li>
	<li>Collect crystals to power massive doors leading you to the next level.</li>
	<li>Use your energy shield to absorb incoming fire, or destroy enemies by ramming them.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Rail Recon is inspired by „Elevator Action“ developed by Taito in 1983. Rail Recon’s developement was started by a team of first year students at NHTV in Breda as part of the study and is now being continued by a part of the original team. The Goal from the project brief was to choose a game from the 1980’s and re-design its mechanics and aesthetics, while keeping the dynamics of our Reference game. 
	</p>
	<p>Our goal was to make a new game, while keeping true the feeling of our reference game. We wanted to keep the pathfinding dynamic of Elevator Action, as well as creating a rather unpredictable game to make the player always re-stragize. This can be seen in the later, more open levels of the game.
	</p>
	<p>To make this possible we created a rail based movement system with puzzle elements. Combined with combat, we limit the player movement while creating a need to repsond quickly and find a new path.
